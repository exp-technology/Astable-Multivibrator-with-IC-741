Astable Multivibrator with IC 741
Regenerative switching circuits such as Astable Multivibrators are the most commonly used type of relaxation oscillator because not only are they simple, reliable and ease of construction they also produce a constant square wave output waveform.
Components :
1.	Power Supply
2.	Transistor
3.	Capacitor
4.	Resistor
5.	IC 741
